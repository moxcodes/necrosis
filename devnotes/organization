Okay, well, it's pretty clear that I've got a ton of global variable codesmells.
... and the main function is beefy.
... so it's time for some cleanup.


The central cpp file should act primarily as the main loop, dispatching the subroutines. obviously, this is going to rapidly become more complicated than I originally anticipated.


Global variable catagories:
- SDL screen management variables
- Scene variables
- item and character variables

The scene obviously gets its own class,
    as do the item and character variables.

Games are highly modal, so there's a bit of a question how we want to handle that.
- We could have separate render loops for the scene and the overall map, or whatever other types of gameplay we wish to incorporate. The alternative is to have several different modes and a massive switch statement.
...
   Okay I'm convinced. Control needs to pass between the different game modules. We'll start with the main tactical game module.


Tactical module structure 
- Looping routines, input handling
- Scene object, with links to all contained items and characters.
  - for better or for worse, this is going to act as the biggest piece here.


Level editing:
Ultimately, the goal here will be to entirely assemble a good scene object, which can be exported. One immediate goal is to create the majority of the scene structure

Scene
- layers (vector?)
- - tiles


Rendering:



Repositioning:
The player/editor should be able to shift the viewport or zoom the scene, so we need to have a crisp disconnect from the scene position and size to the window position and size.

zooming: all coordinates, widths, and heights should be scaled by the zoom factor.

shifting: all coordintes should be shifted by the shift value.


For now, I'll just put zoom and shift values in the scene.

The rectangle will be defined by the scene position and size, multiplied and shifted by the above transformations.
